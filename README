Quaternion-Diagonalization
==========================

Code to diagonalize quaternion matrices using symmetry-adapted eigenvectors.

Goal: Generalized Householder with threading and parallelization that is competitive to MKL's zheev and pzheev(r).
Status: Competitive for any matrices when only 1 CPU core is used.
