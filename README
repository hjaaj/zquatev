Synopsis:
    This program diagonalizes quaternionic matrices,

    (  A  -B* )
    (  B   A* )

    where A is Hermitian and B is anti-Hermitian. Only the left half of the matrix
    will be referenced as an input.

    This matrix has doubly-degenerate eigenvalues, and there is a set of
    eivenvectors that has the same symmetry property:

    (  U  -V* )
    (  V   U* )
